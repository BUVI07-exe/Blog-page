        <h2>Book Summary</h2>
        <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki is a financial game-changer that challenges everything you thought you knew about money. Through the contrasting wisdom of his two "dads"—his educated but financially struggling biological father and his wealthy, entrepreneurial best friend's father—Kiyosaki powerfully illustrates that <strong>true wealth comes from acquiring assets, not just earning a paycheck</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>It's a wake-up call to prioritize <strong>financial literacy</strong>, understand the crucial difference between assets (things that put money in your pocket) and liabilities (things that take money out), and ultimately, to make your money work for you, rather than working your entire life just for money.</p>
